## Variational Automatic Encoders 

Let's introduce the framework of variational autoencoders (VAEs), referencing works by Kingma and Welling (2014), and Rezende et al. (2014). VAEs are a method for learning deep latent-variable models and inference models using stochastic gradient descent. The framework is applicable to various areas such as generative modeling and semi-supervised learning.

We are going to expand on the earlier work done by Kingma and Welling (2014), focusing on explaining the topic in finer detail and discussing important follow-up work. It is noted that the text is not a comprehensive review of all related work and assumes the reader has basic knowledge of algebra, calculus, and probability theory.

The chapter discussed in the excerpt covers background material on probabilistic models, directed graphical models, and the integration of these models with neural networks, specifically in the context of deep latent-variable models (DLVMs). It also mentions that chapter 2 will cover the basics of VAEs, chapter 3 will delve into advanced inference techniques, and chapter 4 will discuss advanced generative models. The section A.1 is referenced for more information on mathematical notation.

## Generative vs Discriminative Modeling

This section discusses the attractiveness of generative modeling and its various applications. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Expressing Physical Laws and Constraints:**
   - Generative modeling allows the incorporation of physical laws and constraints into the modeling process. Nuisance variables, or details that are not critical, are treated as noise.
   - Resulting models are intuitive and interpretable, and by testing them against observations, theories about how the world works can be confirmed or rejected.

2. **Expressing Causal Relations:**
   - Understanding the generative process of data naturally expresses causal relations in the world.
   - Causal relations generalize better to new situations than mere correlations. Knowledge of the generative process can be applied across different scenarios.

3. **Generative Model to Discriminator:**
   - To turn a generative model into a discriminator, Bayes rule is applied. Comparing different generative models can help compute probabilities for events based on observed data.
   - Applying Bayes rule can be computationally expensive.

4. **Discriminative Methods:**
   - Discriminative methods directly learn a mapping for making future predictions.
   - Unlike generative models, discriminative models map input directly to labels. They may lead to fewer errors in discriminative tasks, especially in situations with a large amount of data.

5. **Semi-Supervised Learning:**
   - Generative modeling can guide the training of discriminative models, especially in semi-supervised learning settings with few labeled examples and many unlabeled examples.

6. **Generative Modeling as an Auxiliary Task:**
   - Generative modeling can serve as an auxiliary task, helping to predict the immediate future and building useful abstractions of the world.
   - This quest for disentangled, semantically meaningful, statistically independent, and causal factors is known as unsupervised representation learning.

7. **Variational Autoencoder (VAE):**
   - The VAE is highlighted as a tool extensively employed for unsupervised representation learning.
   - It is viewed as an implicit form of regularization, biasing the representation to be meaningful for data generation and improving downstream predictions.

Overall, the text emphasizes the versatility of generative modeling in expressing physical laws, understanding causal relations, guiding discriminative models, and serving as an auxiliary task for various applications. The VAE is specifically mentioned as a powerful tool in unsupervised representation learning.



## The Motivation behind VAE

The passage discusses the role of probabilistic models in machine learning, emphasizing their importance in understanding and predicting natural and artificial phenomena. Probabilistic models are described as mathematical representations that formalize knowledge and skill, serving as central constructs in the field of machine learning and AI.

Key points in the passage include:

1. **Purpose of Probabilistic Models:**
   - Probabilistic models are employed to learn mathematical descriptions of phenomena from data.
   - They facilitate understanding, prediction of future unknowns, and various forms of assisted or automated decision-making.

2. **Incorporating Uncertainty:**
   - Due to incomplete data, uncertainty is inherent in probabilistic models.
   - The degree and nature of uncertainty are specified using conditional probability distributions.

3. **Variable Types:**
   - Probabilistic models may involve both continuous and discrete variables.
   - Complete forms of probabilistic models specify all correlations and higher-order dependencies among variables through a joint probability distribution.

4. **Notation and Observations:**
   - The vector $(x)$ represents all observed variables in the model.
   - The observed variable $(x)$ is considered a random sample from an unknown process with an unknown true distribution $(p_{\text{true}}(x))$.
   - An approximation $(p_{\theta}(x))$ is chosen, where $(\theta)$ represents the parameters, to model the underlying process.

5. **Learning Process:**
   - Learning involves finding values for the parameters $(\theta)$ that make the model distribution $(p_{\theta}(x))$ closely approximate the true distribution $(p_{\text{true}}(x))$ for any observed $(x)$.

6. **Flexibility and Incorporating Knowledge:**
   - The model $(p_{\theta}(x))$ should be flexible enough to adapt to the data for accurate modeling.
   - It should also allow the incorporation of prior knowledge about the data distribution.

Overall, the passage highlights the foundational role of probabilistic models in machine learning, emphasizing their use in capturing and understanding uncertain relationships within data. The learning process involves adjusting model parameters to align the model distribution with the true distribution of the observed data.
