### Intro to Formal Semantics for Natural Language

This blog deals with investigations into the meaning behind utterances in the form of a natural language. We will tackle this task more through the lens of a logician. Semantics in generative grammar that we are tackling with has been based on ‘logical’ truth-conditional semantics. This approach relates linguistic expressions to actual states of affairs in the world by means of the concept of truth.

Semantics and Pragmatics are both concerned with ‘meaning’ and a great deal of ink has been spilt trying to define the boundaries between them. We will adopt the position that Pragmatics = Meaning – Truth Conditions (roughly!). For the most part we will be concerned with the meaning of sentences, rather than the meaning of utterances. 

That is, we will not be concerned with the use of sentences in actual discourse, the speech acts they can be used to perform, and so forth. From this perspective, the three sentences in (1) will all have the same meaning because they all ‘involve’ the same state of affairs.

```plaintext
    (1) a Open the window
    b The window is open
    c Is the window open

```

The fact that a) is most likely to convey an assertion, b) a command and c) a question is, according to this approach, a pragmatic fact about the type of speech act language users will typically associate with the declarative, imperative and interrogative syntactic constructions. We will say that all the sentences of (1) convey the same proposition – the semantic ‘value’ of a sentence.

Above is just one example to have a general understanding our mission in this blog.
