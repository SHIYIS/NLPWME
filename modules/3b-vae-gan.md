## Two Popular Generative Modeling Techniques and Their Comparisons

This section discusses two popular generative modeling paradigms: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). VAEs and GANs are seen as having complementary properties. GANs excel in generating high perceptual quality images but lack full support over the data. On the other hand, VAEs, as likelihood-based models, generate more dispersed samples but are better density models according to the likelihood criterion. Hybrid models have been proposed to combine the strengths of both. The community acknowledges the importance of generative models and unsupervised learning in developing intelligent machines, with the hope that VAEs contribute meaningfully to this endeavor.
