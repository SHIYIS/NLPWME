## Measuring Political Subjectivity with Variational Encoding Methods 


In socio-politics, quantified approaches and modeling techniques are applied in supporting and facilitating political analyses. Individuals, parties, committees and other political entities come together and try to push forward campaigns in hope to receive appropriate patrionization and support for their political agenda. 

The Political Action Committees (PACs or Super PACs) amass funding resources that could benefit the elections. These type of fundings could be from other individuals, or political entities. For the sole of purpose of understanding what the processes of fund raising activities like these really are, this part of the project explores the 2021-2022 PACs financial data.

This part of the project will first present the receipts, disbursements, and other expenditures in terms of propagating political actions in visualization format grounded in states; for example, how many different political action committees there are by US states. This part of the project will also break down all the candidates of 2022 their basic information as mentioned above including their basic demographics, political party affiliation, election cycle, and incumbency.

All info is retrievable through the Federal Election Commission's directory. This project seeks to conduct the research with full transparency and abide to relevant code of conduct.

## The Motivation behind This Project 


This project tries to help someone who is interested in voting activities understand the political leaning of a candidate for federal elections. 

draws inspiration from website like OpenSecrets and this paper, where it strives to uncover information of a politician's agenda and activities (campaign-related or financial).

helps the general population who is interested in partaking in political activities understand a politician (or anyone who authors political content)'s leaning/stance by extracting crucial information from relevant political text. 

## Issue 

Measuring political sentiment and polarization is a common practice in the realm of social science research. However, it may also be applicable to solving business problems, like providing more information about a certain candidate to voters to fill the information gap and facilitate voting processes. 

Website like OpenSecrets provides valuable statistics and educational information to start. This project tries to top it off by retrieving organic information (Tweets) of said candidates and conduct analysis accordingly.
