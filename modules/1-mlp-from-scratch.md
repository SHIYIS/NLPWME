# Homework 1: MLP from scratch

Homework 1 is in the form of a jupyter notebook. You must complete it and submit it on moodle (for students enrolled on this course).

[The Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dataflowr/notebooks/blob/master/HW1/hw1_mlp.ipynb)

This homework will run fine on regular CPU (no need for GPU). If you want to run it locally (on your laptop), you can follow the procedure described in [Module 0](/module0/). Note that if you cloned the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dataflowr/notebooks), the homework will be in the folder `/notebooks/HW1`
