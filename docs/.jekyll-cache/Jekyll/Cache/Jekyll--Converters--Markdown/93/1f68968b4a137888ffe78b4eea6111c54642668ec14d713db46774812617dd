<p>In a different <a href="https://shiyis.github.io/nlpwme/modules/1h-semantics/">blog</a>, I have briefly introduced some of the most important concepts of logic and problem solving, including but not limited to predicate calculus, propositional logic, and lambda calculus.</p>

<p>In this blog, the notes will be more in detail and introduce relevant ideas.</p>

<h4 id="defining-entailment-implicatures-and-presuppositions">Defining Entailment, Implicatures, and Presuppositions</h4>

<p><strong>Implicatures</strong>: What’s suggested in an utterance, even though it is not explicitly stated or entailed by the utterance.</p>

<p><strong>Entailment</strong>: Entailment is a relationship between statements where one statement necessarily follows from another. If statement A entails statement B, then if A is true, B must also be true.</p>

<p><strong>Presuppositions</strong>: A presupposition is an assumption that as speaker makes about what the listener already knows or believes to be true. It’s information taken for granted in the utterance.</p>

<h3 id="differences-between-the-above-three">Differences Between The Above Three</h3>

<p>Sure! Let’s define implicatures, entailments, and presuppositions and compare their differences in simple terms</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Nature of Meaning</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Implicature</strong>: Implied meaning that relies on context and shared understanding. It is not directly stated but inferred.</li>
      <li><strong>Entailment</strong>: Logical meaning that follows necessarily from the truth of another statement. It is a strict logical relationship.</li>
      <li><strong>Presupposition</strong>: Assumed background information or beliefs. It is taken for granted by the speaker as known to the listener.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dependence on Context</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Implicature</strong>: Highly dependent on context. The same statement can imply different things in different situations.</li>
      <li><strong>Entailment</strong>: Not dependent on context. If the antecedent is true, the consequent must be true regardless of context.</li>
      <li><strong>Presupposition</strong>: Partially dependent on context. It relies on shared knowledge but is less flexible than implicature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Truth Conditions</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Implicature</strong>: Can be canceled or denied without contradiction. For example, “It’s cold in here” doesn’t necessarily mean the speaker wants the window closed if they follow up with, “But I like it that way.”</li>
      <li><strong>Entailment</strong>: Cannot be canceled without contradiction. If “All cats are animals” is true, saying “No cats are animals” would be a direct contradiction.</li>
      <li><strong>Presupposition</strong>: Remains even if the statement is negated. For example, “John’s brother is not tall” still presupposes that John has a brother.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Example Comparisons</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Implicature</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Statement: “Can you pass the salt?”</li>
          <li>Implicature: The speaker is asking you to pass the salt, not questioning your ability to do so.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Entailment</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Statement: “She is a mother.”</li>
          <li>Entailment: She has a child. If “She is a mother” is true, it logically follows that “She has a child” must be true.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Presupposition</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Statement: “The king of France is bald.”</li>
          <li>Presupposition: There is a king of France. This assumption is taken for granted by the speaker.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Implicatures</strong> are implied meanings that depend on context and can be canceled without contradiction.</li>
  <li><strong>Entailments</strong> are logical consequences that must be true if the initial statement is true, and they cannot be canceled without contradiction.</li>
  <li><strong>Presuppositions</strong> are background assumptions that remain true even if the statement is negated and depend on shared knowledge between the speaker and listener.</li>
</ul>

<p>By understanding these differences, we can better analyze and interpret the subtleties of communication and language use.</p>
