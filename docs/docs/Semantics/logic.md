#### This blog will continue with the content on logic and problem solving
{: .fs-3 .fw-700}


In a different [blog](https://shiyis.github.io/nlpwme/modules/1h-semantics/), I have briefly introduced some of the most important concepts of logic and problem solving, including but not limited to predicate calculus, propositional logic, and lambda calculus.

In this blog, the notes will be more in detail and introduce relevant ideas.


#### Defining Entailment, Implicatures, and Presuppositions


**Implicatures**: What's suggested in an utterance, even though it is not explicitly stated or entailed by the utterance.

**Entailment**: Entailment is a relationship between statements where one statement necessarily follows from another. If statement A entails statement B, then if A is true, B must also be true.

**Presuppositions**: A presupposition is an assumption that as speaker makes about what the listener already knows or believes to be true. It's information taken for granted in the utterance.


### Differences Between The Above Three


Sure! Let's define implicatures, entailments, and presuppositions and compare their differences in simple terms

1. **Nature of Meaning**:
   - **Implicature**: Implied meaning that relies on context and shared understanding. It is not directly stated but inferred.
   - **Entailment**: Logical meaning that follows necessarily from the truth of another statement. It is a strict logical relationship.
   - **Presupposition**: Assumed background information or beliefs. It is taken for granted by the speaker as known to the listener.

2. **Dependence on Context**:
   - **Implicature**: Highly dependent on context. The same statement can imply different things in different situations.
   - **Entailment**: Not dependent on context. If the antecedent is true, the consequent must be true regardless of context.
   - **Presupposition**: Partially dependent on context. It relies on shared knowledge but is less flexible than implicature.

3. **Truth Conditions**:
   - **Implicature**: Can be canceled or denied without contradiction. For example, "It’s cold in here" doesn’t necessarily mean the speaker wants the window closed if they follow up with, "But I like it that way."
   - **Entailment**: Cannot be canceled without contradiction. If "All cats are animals" is true, saying "No cats are animals" would be a direct contradiction.
   - **Presupposition**: Remains even if the statement is negated. For example, "John's brother is not tall" still presupposes that John has a brother.

4. **Example Comparisons**:

   - **Implicature**:
     - Statement: "Can you pass the salt?"
     - Implicature: The speaker is asking you to pass the salt, not questioning your ability to do so.
   - **Entailment**:
     - Statement: "She is a mother."
     - Entailment: She has a child. If "She is a mother" is true, it logically follows that "She has a child" must be true.
   - **Presupposition**:
     - Statement: "The king of France is bald."
     - Presupposition: There is a king of France. This assumption is taken for granted by the speaker.

### Summary

- **Implicatures** are implied meanings that depend on context and can be canceled without contradiction.
- **Entailments** are logical consequences that must be true if the initial statement is true, and they cannot be canceled without contradiction.
- **Presuppositions** are background assumptions that remain true even if the statement is negated and depend on shared knowledge between the speaker and listener.

By understanding these differences, we can better analyze and interpret the subtleties of communication and language use.
